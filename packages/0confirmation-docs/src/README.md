# What is 0confirmation

0confirmation is a layer 2 network designed to provide rapid access to a user's BTC holdings, to be used via modern DeFi platforms, as well as other Ethereum applications. The system makes use of RenVM as a trustless cryptosystem to bridge other cryptocurrencies to Ethereum, then adds a peer-to-peer signaling network for automated verification of incoming transfers, and provisioning of temporary liquidatable wallets (also known as a "borrow proxy") to access existing liquidity on the Ethereum chain, until the 6 confirmation event occurs in the target chain, and the RenVM darknodes publish a valid signature to shift in the assets onto Ethereum. When the shift event occurs on Ethereum, the lending pool receives the newly shifted assets, the "keeper" is transferred a small fee, and the borrow proxy portfolio can be absorbed by the borrower.
